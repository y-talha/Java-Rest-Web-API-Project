This is a REST API project made with Intellij Idea. We used code-first approach to create databases and the user can use all of CRUD operation by Postman or Swagger. It uses local database and you can change data informations inside by  web API's. The URL mapping for this application declared in controllers and wrong use of URL's will cause errors. There is also exceptions prepared by us for special situations for example there is no data with this ID etc. We used MVC so there is Repository structure for handling the database and dto's for data transferring. The dependencies needed for this code to work are declared in pom.xml file.
